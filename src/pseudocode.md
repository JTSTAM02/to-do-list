# To-Do List (React)

## MoSCoW

    - Must-Haves: 
        * Create UI (input bar with dropdown)
        * Allow User to Create List Items
        * Sort Items by three views: All, Completed,and To-Do (not completed)
        * Allow user to check off an item as "completed"
        * Show count of remaining items
        * Allow user to remove an item from the list
        * check off or cross out all items in one click with "complete all"
        * allow user to press a single button for all checked off items to become active again
        * localStorage to save data in state
        * Must be responsive across all web sizes (Bootstrap)

    - Should-Haves: 
        * Sub sections


    -Could-Haves:
        * Option to separate by importance

    -Won't-Haves/Wish:
        * Options to separate by email accounts/logins 

## Atomic Design Principles
    - Header as atom
    - Input field as molecule
    - To Do List as organism


## User Stories
    - As a user. I can view my to do list, so that I can see the items I need to complete.
    
    - As a user, I can edit my to do list, so that I can make changes to the items when needed

    - As a user, I can delete my to do list items, so that I can show what items I have completed so far

    - As a user, I can end the page and return later to see my information intact so that I can see my information over time


## Questions
    - How do I collect user input and store it into localStorage?
    - How do I add an option to add an item and x out an item dynamically once the user enters an item on their to do list?
    - How do I sort the data into different views while maintaining best practices? (DRY)
    - What componenets do I need to create to ensure the project meets the requirements?
